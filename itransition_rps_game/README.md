# Rock papper scissors game

## How to run a program? 

You must indicate the correct data (the number of participants is more than 3 and no more than 9, the number must also be odd), for example: stone, papper, scissors, lizard, spock and then choose who you are going to play for.
If you use jar assembly, then the launch will look like this (java -jar jarfilename.jar rock paper scissors lizard spock).
